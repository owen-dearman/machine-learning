<!-- 
    We provide a line and work out whether each input is 1 or 0 based on being above or below the line
    We create our perceptron and train it to detect whether the point is above or below the line
    Each input is trained 10,000 times.
        It starts with a random weight and returns 1 or 0 based on this
        If desired (1/0) - guess (1/0) = 0
            then it guessed the right result
        If !==0
            then it guessed the wrong result
            adjusts each weight in the model by
                weight * learning weight (0.0001) * error(1/-1) * input no.
        This means that next time the model is trained, the weights have been adjusted and the guesses so be more accurate
    You can see that even after this training, not all of the points are the right colour
    This can be improved by increasing the number of times the model is trained
